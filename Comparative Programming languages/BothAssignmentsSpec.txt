Comparing Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming
Implement the following program in an imperative style and an object-oriented style using any languages you choose provided they have an open-source implementation.

Implement a to-do list program that stores the list of things to do in a queue (first-in/first-out). Each item in the to-do list can be either a task or an event. Tasks have a date, a start time, a duration and a list of people assigned to the task. An event has a date, a start time and a location.

Submission

This is an individual assignment. You should submit, by email to David.Sinclair@dcu.ie, all the source files in a Winzip file along with a declaration that this is solely your own work (except elements that are explicitly attributed to another source), and a report that compares and contrasts the two programs, by 10am on Monday 20th November 2017.

Marks will be awarded for

the imperative implementation,
the object-oriented implementation, and
the analytical comparison of the two implementations.
Submissions without the declaration of that the assignment is the student's own work will not be assessed. The assignment carries 15 marks and late submissions will incur a 1.5 mark penalty for each 24 hours after the submission.

Comparing Logic Programming and Functional Programming
Implement the following program using a logic programming language and a functional programming language. You can choose any language capable of logic programming and functional programming provided they have an open-source implementation.

Implement a program that returns the longest common prefix of a list of strings. For example, given the list
["interview", "interrupt", "integrate", "intermediate"]
the longest common prefix is "inte".

the efficiency of the two implementations and
the analytical comparison of the two implementations.
